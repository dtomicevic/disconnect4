# disconnect4

This is a distributed implementation of the famous game
[connect4](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connect_Four) made for the [parallel
programming class](http://www.fer.unizg.hr/en/course/parpro). Most of the code
is written in C++ with MPI. The game features fast bitboard game states
and alpha beta prunning distributed game tree search.

The code is greatly inspired by the John Tromp's
[fhourstones](https://github.com/qu1j0t3/fhourstones) benchmark.
